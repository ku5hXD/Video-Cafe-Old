# Video-Cafe
This is a video sharing website. This website is at a very starting stage. We have not hosted this website yet, and the database (using MongoDB) is also local. Our first priority is to add Authentication to the website, then host this website (using Heroku, mostly), and use MongoDB Atlas for DataBase. Then we will look forward to add features like: Like, Comment, Share, Delete, Update info. , Trending pages etc.
